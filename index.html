    <h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The communities offer many activities for guided visits that allow visitors to enjoy Sequoia National Park natural beauty. More than 1 million visitors travel to Sequoia National Park every year to see the magnificent and majestic trees. Simply driving through the park is awe-inspiring, but to truly experience its unforgettable sights, you'll need to get out of your car, either to stand next to one of the trees in the Giant Forest, hike to a scenic overlook or explore an underground cave.</p>

<h3>The Trails></h3>
<p>Lace up your hiking boots, or slip on your sneakers - there are more than 1,000 miles of Sequoia & Kings Canyon hiking trails for visitors of every ability and inclination. From gentle ambles among giant sequoias to moderate day hikes and full-throttle ascents (including the highest point in the lower 48 states!), Sequoia & Kings Canyon hiking trails deliver peak experiences, whatever the topography and terrain.</p>
